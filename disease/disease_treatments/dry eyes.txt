to treat dry eyes:-
People with dry eyes can use eye drops (artificial tears).
Medications to reduce inflammation of the eyelid. Inflammation along the edge of the eyelid can prevent the sebaceous glands from secreting sebum in tears. Your doctor may recommend antibiotics to reduce inflammation. Antibiotics for dry eyes are usually taken by mouth, while some are used as eye drops or ointment.
Eye drops to control keratitis. Inflammation on the surface of your eye (cornea) may be controlled with prescription eye drops containing an immunosuppressive drug called cyclosporine (Restasis) or corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are not ideal for long-term use; Because of its potential side effects.
Eye inserts that act like artificial tears. If your dry eyes symptoms are moderate to severe and artificial tears aren't helping, another option may be a small eye insert that looks like a clear grain of rice. You can place a hydroxypropylcellulose (Lacricert) insert between the lower eyelid and the eyeball once a day. The insert slowly dissolves, releasing a substance that is used in eye drops to lubricate the eyes.
Tear stimulating drugs. Medications called cholinergic drugs (pilocarpine and cevimeline) help increase tear production. These medications are available as pills, gels, or eye drops. Possible side effects include sweating.
Eye drops made from your own blood. These drops of blood serum are called autologous. It may be an option if you have severe dry eye symptoms that don't respond to any other treatment. To make these eye drops, a sample of blood is processed to remove red blood cells, then mixed with a salt solution.
