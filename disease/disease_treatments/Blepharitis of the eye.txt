For the treatment of Blepharitis of the eye:-
Medicines that fight infection. Antibiotics used on the eyelids have been shown to relieve symptoms and treat bacterial infections of the eyelids. These medications are available in several forms, including eye drops, creams and ointments.
If you don't respond to topical antibiotics, your doctor may suggest an oral antibiotic.
Medicines to control inflammation. Steroid drops or ointments are used for this purpose, and generally to treat people who don't respond to other types of treatments. Your doctor may prescribe these anti-inflammatory medications and antibiotics.
Medicines that affect the immune system. Topical cyclosporine (Restasis) has been shown to relieve some of the signs and symptoms of blepharitis.
Customized treatments for underlying disease states. Blepharitis caused by seborrheic dermatitis, acne rosacea or other diseases can be controlled by treating the underlying condition.

There are other treatments:-
Such as the use of intense light pulses, in opening the glands. But it needs more study.

Rarely, blepharitis may go away completely. Even with successful treatment, the condition is often chronic and requires daily attention with eyelid swabs. If you don't respond to treatment, or if your eyelashes also fall out or only one eye is affected, localized eyelid cancer may be the cause.
