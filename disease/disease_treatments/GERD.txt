to pretect GERD:-
Medicines with medicinal properties to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):

Prescription related H2 receptor blockers. These include the prescription medications famotidine (Pepcid) and nizatidine. patients' bodies

Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors. These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). Patients generally tolerate these drugs, but they can cause diarrhea, headache, nausea, and vitamin B-12 deficiency. Long-term use may increase the likelihood of a hip fracture.
Lower esophageal sphincter strengthening medications. Baclofen may relieve gastroesophageal reflux by decreasing the rate at which the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes. It may be a side effect of fatigue or nausea.

If the disease is severe and to avoid treatment for long periods, it is preferable:-
Fundoplication. The surgeon wraps the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter to narrow the muscles and prevent reflux. Fundoplication is a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. The upper part of the stomach can be partially or completely wrapped.
Linux machine (LINX). A ring of small, magnetic beads is wound around the point between the stomach and the esophagus. The magnetic attraction between these beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to the reflux acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. A Linux device can be implanted using a minimally invasive procedure.
